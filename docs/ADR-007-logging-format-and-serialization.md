## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need for a standardized, deterministic logging format that can be efficiently serialized and deserialized to support event replay and debugging.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "All scheduler and agent events will be logged as structured JSON objects following a defined schema. Timestamps will be based on the scheduler's logical tick clock, not wall-clock time, to ensure deterministic replay."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as determinism and reproducibility.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision.]
