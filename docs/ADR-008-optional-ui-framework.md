## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need to select a primary framework for the optional, decoupled UI, balancing performance, developer experience, and ecosystem independence.]

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "We will prioritize Servo as the primary UI framework for its lightweight nature and independence from the Chromium ecosystem. Electron will be maintained as a secondary, fallback option for scenarios requiring deep Node.js integration in the UI process."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as the headless-first operating model and the strategic goal of minimizing dependency on Electron.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision.]
