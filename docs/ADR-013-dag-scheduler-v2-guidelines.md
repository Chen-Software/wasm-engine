## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need for a forward-looking plan to evolve the scheduler from a simple linear queue to a more powerful Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based system for managing complex agent dependencies.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "The v2 scheduler will extend the existing task object to include explicit dependencies. The orchestrator will perform a topological sort to create a deterministic execution plan, while ensuring the core invariants of the runtime are maintained."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing the "Future Extensions" section of the PRD and the need to support more complex multi-agent workflows.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision.]
