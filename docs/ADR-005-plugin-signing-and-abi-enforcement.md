## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need for a security model that ensures only trusted agent plugins can be loaded and that they adhere to the runtime's ABI contract.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "All WASM agent plugins must be cryptographically signed. The orchestrator will verify the signature before loading a plugin and will enforce strict ABI versioning and capability declarations at runtime."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as security, isolation, and the extensible agent framework.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision, such as increased security at the cost of a more complex plugin development workflow.]
