# ADR-011: Fault Injection & Stress Testing

## 1. Context

[Explain the context and problem statement here. This ADR should define the validation scenarios for crash recovery and system resilience.]

## 2. Decision

[State the decision clearly. For example, a decision might be to implement a fault injection framework that can simulate agent crashes, network failures, and other error conditions.]

## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between the complexity of the testing framework and the level of confidence in the system's resilience.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen fault injection and stress testing strategy.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
