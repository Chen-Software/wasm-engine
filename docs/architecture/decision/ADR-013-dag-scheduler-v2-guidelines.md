# ADR-013: DAG Scheduler v2 Guidelines

## 1. Context

[Explain the context and problem statement here. This ADR should define the guidelines for the v2 Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduler, including task objects, dependencies, and v2 extensions.]

## 2. Decision

[State the decision clearly. For example, a decision might be to define a specific data structure for task objects and a set of rules for expressing dependencies between them.]

## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between the expressiveness of the DAG scheduler and its implementation complexity.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen DAG scheduler guidelines.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
