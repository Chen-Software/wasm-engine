# ADR-006: Performance & Latency Targets

## 1. Context

[Explain the context and problem statement here. This ADR should define the metrics for CPU/GPU performance and messaging latency.]

## 2. Decision

[State the decision clearly. For example, a decision might be to set specific targets for scheduler tick overhead, agent step execution time, and message throughput.]

## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between performance goals and implementation complexity.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen performance and latency targets.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
