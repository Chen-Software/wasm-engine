# ADR-008: Optional UI Framework

## 1. Context

[Explain the context and problem statement here. This ADR should discuss the trade-offs between Servo and Electron for the optional UI layer, and the decoupling mechanism from the core runtime.]

## 2. Decision

[State the decision clearly. For example, a decision might be to recommend Servo for lightweight visualization and Electron for more complex UIs, with a clear IPC-based decoupling strategy.]

## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between performance, features, and development complexity for each UI framework.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen UI framework strategy.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
