# ADR-007: Logging Format & Serialization

## 1. Context

[Explain the context and problem statement here. This ADR should define the deterministic event serialization format for logging and replay.]

## 2. Decision

[State the decision clearly. For example, a decision might be to use a specific serialization format like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack for all logged events.]

## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between serialization performance, data size, and ease of use.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen logging format and serialization method.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
