## 3. Rationale

[Explain the reasoning behind the decision. This should cover the trade-offs between build complexity, ease of deployment, and the size of the final distributable.]

## 4. Consequences

[Describe the positive, negative, and trade-off consequences of the chosen cross-platform build and packaging strategy.]

## 5. Status

Proposed.
