## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need for a formal strategy to validate the runtime's resilience, fault tolerance, and performance under extreme conditions.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "We will develop a suite of tests that inject faults (e.g., agent crashes, ONNX model failures) and apply synthetic stress workloads to validate the runtime's adherence to its fault tolerance and performance NFRs."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as fault tolerance, performance, and the acceptance criteria.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision.]
