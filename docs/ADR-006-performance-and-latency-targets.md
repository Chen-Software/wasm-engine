## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need to define specific, measurable performance targets for the core runtime components to guide optimization efforts and ensure the system meets its non-functional requirements.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen targets, e.g., "The runtime will target a scheduler tick overhead of <10ms per 50 agents, CPU agent step execution of <5ms, and a message throughput of at least 10,000 messages per second via the orchestrator."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind these specific targets, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as performance and latency.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision.]
