## 1. Context

[A detailed description of the problem space and the need for a decision on the logical tick duration and the maximum number of tasks that can be processed per tick.]

---

## 2. Decision

[A clear statement of the chosen approach, e.g., "The scheduler will operate on a logical tick of 10ms, processing a maximum of 100 tasks per tick to ensure bounded execution."]

---

## 3. Rationale

[The reasons behind the decision, referencing key requirements from the PRD such as performance overhead and deterministic execution.]

---

## 4. Consequences

[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision, such as the trade-off between throughput and latency.]
